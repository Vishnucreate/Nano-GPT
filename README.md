Nano GPT Transformers

Nano GPT Transformers is a lightweight version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. It has been specifically designed to be resource-efficient and easily deployable on devices with limited computational capabilities.

Features:

Lightweight: Nano GPT Transformers has a smaller model size and requires fewer computational resources compared to the original GPT model.
Fast Inference: The model is optimized for quick inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Easy Deployment: Nano GPT Transformers can be deployed on devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems, and edge devices.
Language Generation: The model can generate text in a conversational or contextual manner, based on the provided input.
Installation:
To install Nano GPT Transformers, follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/nano-gpt-transformers.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained model weights: [link_to_model_weights]
Place the downloaded model weights in the appropriate directory.
Run the demo script: python demo.py
Usage:
After installing Nano GPT Transformers, you can use it in your Python code as follows:

python
Copy code
from nano_gpt_transformers import NanoGPT

# Load the model
model = NanoGPT()

# Generate text
prompt = "Once upon a time"
output = model.generate_text(prompt, max_length=100)
